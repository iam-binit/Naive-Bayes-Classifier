# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This is a classic example of the Naive Bayes Classifier being used on a News data set where it can predict the category in which the news should be from headlines.

The Jupyter Notebook file has all the essential code 
You just have to use to function 
predict_category('') 
And insert the keywords and it would return a category in which the news should be in.
